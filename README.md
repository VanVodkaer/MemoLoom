### About This Project

Isn't the first project of every beginner a notebook? (smile)

It is often said that theoretical knowledge gained from books is superficial, and I usually focus on studying theory, but after a while, I felt a bit lost in direction. So, I decided to try writing a "somewhat useful" small program.

Actually writing it down, I encountered many difficulties. There are still many features I want to implement that are beyond my current capabilities, so I will gradually improve them while continuing to learn.
